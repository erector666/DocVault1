## [2025-01-02] - UX Improvement: Remove Redundant Category Filtering

### 🎯 User Experience Enhancement
- **Removed redundant "Filter by Category" card** from Dashboard

### ✅ Logic Behind the Change
- **Sidebar already provides**: Complete category navigation with document counts
- **Sidebar advantages**: Better organization, hierarchy, and navigation flow
- **Dashboard focus**: Now focuses on search and document list without redundancy
- **Single source of truth**: Categories are managed in one place (sidebar) instead of two

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Removed CategoryFilter import and usage
- **documents/index.ts**: Removed CategoryFilter export
- **CategoryFilter.tsx**: File completely deleted
- **State management**: Simplified Dashboard component state
