# AppVault Architecture

## Overview

AppVault is built using a modern React architecture with TypeScript, following best practices for maintainability, scalability, and performance.

## Core Architecture Components

### Frontend

- **React with TypeScript**: For type-safe component development
- **Context API**: For global state management (theme, language)
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing
- **React Query**: For data fetching, caching, and state management

### Backend Services

- **Firebase Authentication**: For user authentication and management
- **Firebase Firestore**: For document metadata storage
- **Firebase Storage**: For document file storage
- **Firebase Functions**: For serverless backend operations

## Data Flow

1. User uploads documents through the UI
2. Documents are processed by AI services for classification and recognition
3. Document metadata is stored in Firestore
4. Document files are stored in Firebase Storage
5. UI retrieves and displays documents based on user queries

## Component Structure

- **Layout Components**: Define the overall application structure
- **Page Components**: Represent different views/routes in the application
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements used across the application
- **Service Modules**: Handle API calls and data processing
- **Context Providers**: Manage global state and provide it to components
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate reusable logic

## Security Considerations

- Authentication using Firebase Auth
- Firestore security rules for data access control
- Storage security rules for file access control
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
